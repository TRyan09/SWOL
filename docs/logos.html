    <title>The Logos of SWOL</title>
</head>

    <h1>Why so many logos ?: Guidelines on which logo to use and how</h1>

        <li>
            <h2>The Upside Down Snail</h2>
            <img src="logos/SWOL Logo.svg" alt="logo of SWOL">
            <p>
                This represents a snail that is upside down and that twists and bends to form the letters "SWOL".
                <br>
                Under are the captions "Slow, Weird, One-Line ...and a mispelling of SLOW !". 
                <br>
                That mispelling is based on the fact that Python (the language that SWOL is based on) is very slow compared to other languages and, 
                <br>
                that is also why the SWOL logo is a snail.
            </p>
            <p>This logo should be used when explaining the language as a whole.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>The Strange Snail</h2>
            <img src="logos/dot_swol Logo.svg" alt="logo of the .swol file extension">
            <p>
                It's just like the previous logo but the snail is deformed and there's a dot in front of the snail.
                The captions say "Script With One Line".
            </p>
            <p>This logo should be used when talking about the file extension (.swol)</p>
            <p>NOTE: the .swol file extension is nothing but a simple text file</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>The Icon</h2>
            <img src="logos/SWOL Icon.svg" alt="logo of the swol icon">
            <p>
                It's simple beacause it's just the S of the upside down snail
            </p>
            <p>Use this logo when you want to put it as an icon (favicon, app icon, etc...)</p>
